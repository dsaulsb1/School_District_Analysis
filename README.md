# School_District_Analysis
##Project Overview:
The Data we were tasked to analyze during the module shows evidence of academic dishonesty. The grades for Thomas High School ninth graders seem to have been altered. We are tasked with separating the THS 9th Grade Data, and while keeping the rest intact, performing an analysis on the clean data.

##Resources:
-Data Source: students_complete.csv -Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebok (Anaconda3) 

##Steps:
-Cleaning data via replacing 9th grade scores
-Repeating previously completed analysis using the new data
-Analyze how the false data affected the other numbers

The Data from Thomas High School clearly imbalanced the scores, and falsely inflated the school's numbers. With the numbers removed, we are able to see considerable changes in the rest of the data.

##Summary:
This module took up a substantial portion of my time this week. As this is due in 10 minutes, I will end this here. Hopefully next week won't be as hectic and I can finish on time!
